Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses simple, plain-text syntax to format documents for easy readability and writing. Created by John Gruber in 2004, it's designed to be converted into HTML or other 

formats, allowing users to focus on content rather than complex code. Common uses for Markdown include writing documentation, creating notes, blogging, and crafting content for large language models
